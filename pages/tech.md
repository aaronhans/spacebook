The technology that supports State websites is critical to delivering accessible services to all Californians. We deliver technologically great services through:

* __Using [web components](../tech/web-components/) to build user interface widgets__ that work across any stack to give our work more portability and longevity.
* __Delivering fast web sites.__ Using [web components](../tech/web-components/) and [static site generation](../tech/ssg/) allow us to render pages fast and deliver advanced functionality with small code footprints so the user experience retains quality even for users with less expensive devices.
* __Prioritizing speed and accessibility__ even when building highly dynamic dashboards. The [equity dashboard](https://covid19.ca.gov/equity/) is an example of making sure translations, screen reader navigation, and fast time to interaction can be achieved while delivering [complex data visualizations](../tech/fast-dashboards/). 
* __Architecting systems that require smaller production footprints.__ We use [static site generation](../tech/ssg/) and [serverless API patterns](../tech/serverless/) to run resilient, scalable systems with less production hardware. These practices let us handle bursty traffic at low cost, get higher SLAs from cloud providers, and require less operations management from our staff.
* __Integrating [continuous testing](../tech/performance/)__ to make sure we maintain functional, accessibility, and performance goals with each code change.
