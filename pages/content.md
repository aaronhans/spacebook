Good content gives people the information they need in a way they can understand. We create content that serves Californians using these resources:

* [Our content principles](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-handbook/content/principles.html)
* [How we format content](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-handbook/content/formatting.html)
* [Using the right type of content for the situation](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-handbook/content/types.html)
