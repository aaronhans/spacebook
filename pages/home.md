California's Office of Digital Innovation is dedicated to improving digital experiences for all Californians.

We're guided by the following principles:

* Start with user needs
* Do less
* Design with data, research, intuition, and experimentation
* Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant
* Iterate â€” then iterate again
* Make it accessible and inclusive
* Understand context
* Build digital services, not websites
* Be consistent but not uniform
* Make things open: it makes things better
* Prioritize security, respect privacy
* Optimize performance

We put these principles into action in three areas:

* [Design](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-handbook//design/)
* [Content](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-handbook/content/)
* [Tech](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-handbook/tech/)
