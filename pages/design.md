Good design provides Californians with the information and services they need. We create good design through:

* [Design principles](../design/principles.html)
* [Style guide](../design/style-guide.html)

The basis for our design is based on the proven work and best practices of teams like [18F Design Principles](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-principles/) and the [GOV.UK Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).

Examples of our implementation and iteration of the above design principles can be seen on the [alpha.ca.gov](https://www.alpha.ca.gov) and the [COVID19.ca.gov](https://covid19.ca.gov) website.

**Note**: We're iterating on our design through various efforts and a cohesive design system does not yet exist. It's recommended that the COVID-19 and Alpha websites are used as a design reference and implementation guide while the current state web template is the codebase. It's easy to get started with the state web template by leveraging the [content delivery network (CDN)](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov/cdn.html) it's hosted on.
